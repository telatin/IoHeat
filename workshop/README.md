# IoHeat Workshop - 31 October 2019

## Coding a device

Our workshop will introduce the basics concepts of **programming**
in a less usual context: using input/output **electronic components** (like sensors) 
connected to a miniaturized computer, the [Rapspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/what-%20is-a-raspberry-pi/).

## The Raspberry Pi and the Raspian OS

The Raspberry Pi is a miniaturized computer build to be:
 * Cheap
 * Small (can be [https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-zero/](smaller))
 * Easy to use
 * Easy to connect to electronic components
 * Easy to use as a training and prototyping device
 
 Being a computer, you must install an Opearting System. Currently you can install a variety of Linux flavours, and a stripped down [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55029) version.
 We'll focus on the offically supported Linux distribution called **Rasbpian OS**. It comes with pre-installed software and can easily install Raspberry specific packages (in addition to most software you would use under Linux).
