# Setting up your Raspberry Pi

### Connect the cables
You will need to connect the Monitor (HDMI port), a keyboard and a mouse (USB) and finally you'll need to plug the SenseHat on the GPIO port.


### Install software and workshop files

You'll need to install the libraries needed to operate with SenseHat, and to download the files of this repository.
Open the Terminal (Raspberry menu -> Accessories -> Terminal) and type these commands, hitting Enter after each line:

```
cd
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sense-hat
git clone https://github.com/telatin/ioheat/
```
